### Sample Days

#### Day 1: Brain Dump Liberation
🎯 Get everything out of your head and onto paper (digital or physical)

⏱️ Time: 10 minutes
💪 Energy: Low (perfect for starting)
🎁 Reward: Favorite beverage or snack

Your ADHD brain is carrying too many open loops. Today, we're creating a "parking lot" for all those thoughts bouncing around.

Step-by-Step:
1. Set a timer for 10 minutes
2. Write EVERYTHING that's on your mind—tasks, worries, ideas, random thoughts
3. Don't organize, don't judge, just dump
4. When timer ends, close the document/notebook and walk away

✨ ADHD Tips:
- Use voice-to-text if writing feels hard
- It's okay if it's messy—that's the point!
- You don't have to do any of these things today

Reflection Prompt:
How does your brain feel after getting that all out?

Tomorrow Preview: We'll start organizing that brain dump (gently!)

#### Day 7: Dopamine Menu Creation
🎯 Build your personal "emergency joy" list

⏱️ Time: 15 minutes
💪 Energy: Medium
🎁 Reward: Try one item from your new menu!

Create a menu of activities that give you dopamine hits, organized by time and energy.

Step-by-Step:
1. List 5 activities for each category:
   - Quick (5 min): [examples: favorite song, pet snuggles, funny video]
   - Medium (15-30 min): [examples: short walk, creative hobby, call a friend]
   - Long (60+ min): [examples: movie, hobby deep-dive, adventure]
2. Note energy required (low/medium/high)
3. Add to your Notion dashboard for easy access
4. Bookmark or save digital versions

✨ ADHD Tips:
- Include "weird" things that work for YOU
- Update this list whenever you discover new favorites
- Use this when you're bored, sad, or need motivation

Reflection Prompt:
What surprised you about what brings you joy?

#### Day 14: Energy Audit
🎯 Track your energy patterns for one full day

⏱️ Time: 2 minutes, 6 times today
💪 Energy: Low (just checking in)
🎁 Reward: Visual chart of your energy patterns

Discover when you naturally have high vs low energy so you can schedule accordingly.

Step-by-Step:
1. Set 6 alarms throughout your day (e.g., 8am, 11am, 2pm, 5pm, 8pm, 11pm)
2. When alarm goes off, rate your energy 1-10
3. Note what you were doing
4. At end of day, look for patterns

✨ ADHD Tips:
- Use the Notion mood tracker template included
- Don't try to change your energy, just observe
- One day gives you data; multiple days show patterns

Reflection Prompt:
What's your peak energy time? What do you want to do during that time?

#### Day 21: Reward System Design
🎯 Create a dopamine-based reward system that actually works

⏱️ Time: 15 minutes
💪 Energy: Medium
🎁 Reward: Give yourself the first reward immediately!

Build a "points" system that motivates without guilt.

Step-by-Step:
1. List tasks you struggle to do consistently
2. Assign points based on difficulty (not importance)
3. Create reward tiers (10 pts, 25 pts, 50 pts, 100 pts)
4. List rewards you genuinely want
5. Set up in Notion or app of choice

✨ ADHD Tips:
- Rewards should feel good, not "should do" activities
- Start with easy wins (collect points fast)
- Reset weekly so you never feel too behind
- Change rewards when they stop being motivating

Reflection Prompt:
What rewards actually motivate you vs what you think "should" motivate you?

#### Day 30: System Reflection & Future Planning
🎯 Celebrate progress and customize your ongoing system

⏱️ Time: 20 minutes
💪 Energy: Medium-High
🎁 Reward: You made it 30 days! Choose something special!

Look back at your journey and set up your sustainable future.

Step-by-Step:
1. Review: What days/strategies worked best?
2. Identify: What can you commit to weekly?
3. Simplify: What can you let go of without guilt?
4. Customize: Adjust your Notion dashboard based on learnings
5. Celebrate: List 10 wins from the past 30 days

✨ ADHD Tips:
- You don't have to keep doing all 30 things
- Choose 3-5 practices to continue
- It's okay if you only did 15 of 30 days—that's still a win!
- Schedule your next check-in (maybe monthly?)

Reflection Prompt:
Who are you becoming through this practice? What do you want to remember?

## 2. Values & Identity Clarifier

### Overview
A deep-dive workbook to help ADHD adults reconnect with their authentic selves, separate from productivity culture and "should" obligations.

### Section 1: Who Am I Beyond My ADHD?

#### Exercise 1.1: Identity Statements
Complete these sentences:
- When I'm at my best, I am...
- People who really know me would describe me as...
- I feel most like myself when I'm...
- My ADHD gives me the gift of...
- Without external pressure, I naturally gravitate toward...

#### Exercise 1.2: Strengths Inventory (ADHD-Positive Frame)
Common ADHD strengths—which are yours?
- ☐ Hyperfocus on interests
- ☐ Creative problem-solving
- ☐ High energy and enthusiasm
- ☐ Thinking outside the box
- ☐ Empathy and emotional depth
- ☐ Resilience (you've adapted to so much!)
- ☐ Spontaneity and fun
- ☐ Justice-oriented thinking
- ☐ Ability to see connections others miss

Rate each 1-10 and give an example of when you used this strength.

### Section 2: Uncovering Your Core Values

#### Exercise 2.1: Values Card Sort
[Provide list of 50+ values: e.g., adventure, security, creativity, connection, freedom, growth, etc.]

Instructions:
1. First pass: Mark any that resonate (no limit)
2. Second pass: Narrow to top 10
3. Third pass: Identify top 5
4. Final pass: Force-rank top 3

For each top 3, write:
- What this value means to you specifically
- When you honor this value, you feel...
- When you ignore this value, you feel...
- One way you can honor this value this week

#### Exercise 2.2: Values Conflict Resolution
Do any of your top values conflict? (e.g., adventure vs. security, freedom vs. connection)

For each conflict:
- Describe the tension
- Both values are valid—how can they coexist?
- What season of life are you in? Which needs more emphasis now?

### Section 3: Who Am I Without Burnout?

#### Exercise 3.1: Burnout Inventory
Rate 1-10 (1=not at all, 10=extremely):

- I've lost interest in things I used to love
- I feel cynical or resentful
- I struggle to accomplish basic tasks
- I feel disconnected from others
- I use numbing behaviors (excess social media, substance use, etc.)

If you scored 40+, you're likely experiencing burnout.

#### Exercise 3.2: Burnout Root Causes
What's driving your burnout? Check all that apply:
- ☐ Overcommitment (saying yes to too much)
- ☐ Perfectionism (nothing is ever good enough)
- ☐ Lack of boundaries (others' needs always come first)
- ☐ Identity tied to productivity (I am what I achieve)
- ☐ Unmanaged ADHD challenges (constant overwhelm)
- ☐ Unsupportive environment (work, relationships, etc.)
- ☐ Ignoring my needs (rest, fun, connection, health)

For each checked, write one small boundary or change you could try.

#### Exercise 3.3: Permission Slips
Write yourself permission for the things you need to heal:

"I give myself permission to..."
- Rest without earning it
- Change my mind
- Disappoint others to protect my peace
- Take things off my plate
- Ask for help
- Be "unproductive" sometimes
- Prioritize joy
- [Your addition]

Sign and date this. Return to it when guilt creeps in.

For any rated 6 or below:

Include:
- What you hope to feel (not just achieve)
