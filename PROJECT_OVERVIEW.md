# ADHD Flow OS - Project Overview

## Core Promise
A complete, forgiving digital system that helps ADHD brains organize life without overwhelm, build sustainable habits, and use AI as a "personal executive function coach."

## Target Customer
Adults 25-45 who are diagnosed or self-identify as ADHD (or AuDHD), feel scattered/burned out, and already love (or are curious about) Notion.

## Why ADHD / Neurodivergent Adults?

### Highest emotional resonance + growing diagnoses
- Notion is hugely popular in the ADHD community
- Most templates are too complex or overwhelming
- An ADHD-optimized, dopamine-friendly Life OS with built-in AI support fills a massive gap

### Market Opportunity
- ADHD searches and dedicated Notion templates are exploding on Etsy, Gumroad, and the official Notion Marketplace
- Users desperately want simple, forgiving, visually engaging systems (bright colors, minimal text, visual cues, body-doubling elements)
- AI prompts tailored to executive dysfunction, task initiation, rejection sensitive dysphoria, hyperfocus, etc., add massive unique value
- High willingness to pay ($67-$197) because it feels life-changing
- Low direct competition for a complete AI-enhanced bundle
