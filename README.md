# ADHD Flow OS - Project Documentation

> **Dopamine-Friendly Life Operating System for ADHD/Neurodivergent Adults**

This repository contains the complete documentation and specifications for building the ADHD Flow OS—a comprehensive digital life management system designed specifically for ADHD brains, featuring AI integration and dopamine-optimized design.

## 📋 Project Overview

ADHD Flow OS is a complete Notion-based life management system that helps ADHD adults organize their lives without overwhelm, build sustainable habits, and use AI as a "personal executive function coach."

**Target Audience:** Adults 25-45 who are diagnosed or self-identify as ADHD (or AuDHD), feel scattered/burned out, and already love (or are curious about) Notion.

**Core Promise:** A forgiving digital system that works WITH your ADHD brain, not against it.
