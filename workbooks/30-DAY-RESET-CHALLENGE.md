## Week 1: Foundation & Brain Clarity

### Day 1: Brain Dump Liberation

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Get everything out of your head and onto paper

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low (perfect for starting)  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Favorite beverage or snack

**Why This Matters**:
Your ADHD brain is carrying too many open loops. Today, we're creating a "parking lot" for all those thoughts bouncing around. No organizing, no judging, just dumping!

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Set a timer for 10 minutes
2. Open a blank document or grab paper
3. Write EVERYTHING that's on your mind:
   - Tasks you need to do
   - Worries you're carrying
   - Ideas you don't want to forget
   - Random thoughts
   - "Someday" dreams
4. Don't organize, don't judge, don't prioritize—just DUMP
5. When the timer ends, close the document/notebook and walk away

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Use voice-to-text if writing feels hard
- It's okay if it's messy—that's the point!
- You don't have to do ANY of these things today
- This is just about getting them out of your working memory

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How does your brain feel after getting that all out? Lighter? Clearer? Overwhelmed looking at the list? All valid!_

**Tomorrow Preview**: We'll start organizing that brain dump (gently!)

---

### Day 2: The Top 3 Rule

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Identify just 3 priorities for today

⏱️ **Time Required**: 5 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: 5-minute stretch or dance break

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD brains struggle with "everything feels urgent." Today, we practice ruthless prioritization—just 3 things.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Look at your brain dump from yesterday (or current to-do list)
2. Ask yourself: "If I could only do 3 things today, which would they be?"
3. Consider:
   - What's actually time-sensitive?
   - What would reduce stress most?
   - What would create momentum?
4. Write your Top 3 in your Notion Daily Dashboard
5. Give yourself permission to ignore everything else today

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- If choosing 3 feels hard, start with 1
- Your Top 3 can be tiny tasks (that's actually better!)
- "Rest" or "Do nothing" can be one of your priorities
- Tomorrow is a new day for different priorities

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How did it feel to give yourself permission to focus on just 3 things? Freeing? Stressful? Why?_

---

### Day 3: The 2-Minute Win

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Complete 3 tasks that take 2 minutes or less

⏱️ **Time Required**: 6-10 minutes total  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Victory dance (seriously, do it!)

**Why This Matters**:
Quick wins create dopamine and momentum. Your brain learns: "Hey, I CAN do things!" This builds confidence for bigger tasks.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Scan your to-do list or brain dump
2. Find 3 tasks that take 2 minutes or less:
   - Send a quick text
   - Throw away trash
   - Put dishes in dishwasher
   - Water a plant
   - Make your bed
   - Reply to one email
3. Set a timer for 2 minutes per task
4. DO THEM NOW (Yes, right now!)
5. Check them off with celebration

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Use the "2-minute rule": If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now
- String tasks together for momentum
- Physically check boxes or cross things off (satisfying!)
- Tell someone about your wins (share the dopamine!)

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How did completing small tasks make you feel? Did momentum build? Did you want to keep going?_

---

### Day 4: Energy Audit

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Track your energy patterns for one full day

⏱️ **Time Required**: 2 minutes, 6 times today  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low (just checking in)  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Visual chart of your energy patterns

**Why This Matters**:
Knowing when you naturally have high vs. low energy helps you schedule tasks appropriately. Work WITH your brain, not against it.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Set 6 alarms throughout your day:
   - Morning (when you wake up)
   - Late morning (around 10-11am)
   - Afternoon (around 2-3pm)
   - Late afternoon (around 5pm)
   - Evening (around 8pm)
   - Before bed
2. When alarm goes off, rate your energy 1-10
3. Note what you were doing
4. Add to your Notion Mood Tracker
5. At end of day, look for patterns

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Use your phone's reminder app
- Don't try to change your energy, just observe
- One day gives you data; multiple days show patterns
- There's no "right" energy pattern—just yours

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What's your peak energy time? When do you crash? How can you use this information?_

---

### Day 5: The Morning Minimum

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Create a 3-step morning routine you can actually stick to

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10 minutes to plan, then test it  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low-Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Extra-good breakfast or coffee

**Why This Matters**:
Morning routines help ADHD brains transition into the day. But complex routines fail. Today: create a minimal, sustainable version.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Think about what helps you most in the morning
2. Choose ONLY 3 things:
   - Example: Take meds, drink water, 5-minute stretch
   - Example: Make bed, eat something, check calendar
3. Put them in order (habit stack!)
4. Write them in your Notion Dashboard
5. Try it tomorrow morning

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Keep it stupidly simple (3 things max)
- Stack on existing habits (after coffee → take meds)
- Don't include "optional" things (save those for bonus)
- Prep what you can the night before
- If you miss it, no guilt—try again next morning

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What would make your mornings feel successful? What drains you in the morning that you can remove?_

---

### Day 6: Digital Brain Dump Zones

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Set up 3 quick-capture spots for racing thoughts

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: 15 minutes of guilt-free scrolling

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD brains have constant interrupting thoughts. Having designated "parking lots" lets you capture without derailing focus.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. In your Notion, create/find these capture zones:
   - 🧠 Brain Dump Database (for tasks/ideas)
   - 💡 Ideas Parking Lot (for creative thoughts)
   - 🐿️ Distraction Log (for "I need to look this up" moments)
2. Add quick-capture buttons to your dashboard
3. Practice using them: Capture 3 random thoughts right now
4. Set up phone widget/shortcut if possible

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- The goal is to DEFER, not to DO
- Don't organize while capturing
- Review these weekly, not daily
- Voice memos work too (for when typing is hard)
- Empty feeling good, not required

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How often do intrusive thoughts break your focus? Would having a trusted place to park them help?_

---

### Day 7: Dopamine Menu Creation

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Build your personal "emergency joy" list

⏱️ **Time Required**: 15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Try one item from your new menu!

**Why This Matters**:
When motivation is low or you need a break, having a pre-made list prevents decision paralysis. You don't have to think—just pick!

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Create three categories in your Notion:
   - **Quick Hits** (5 min): Favorite song, pet snuggles, funny video, stretch
   - **Medium Breaks** (15-30 min): Short walk, creative hobby, call a friend
   - **Long Indulgences** (60+ min): Movie, hobby deep-dive, adventure
2. List 5 activities for each category
3. Note energy required (low/medium/high)
4. Add to your Notion dashboard for easy access
5. Bookmark or save digital versions

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Include "weird" things that work for YOU (no judgment!)
- Update this list whenever you discover new favorites
- Use this when you're: bored, sad, need motivation, or reward
- Permission to do "unproductive" joy activities

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What surprised you about what brings you joy? Any patterns in your list?_

---

## Week 2: Systems & Habits

### Day 8: The Evening Wind-Down

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Create a 5-minute end-of-day ritual

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10 minutes to plan + test  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Cozy evening activity

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD brains struggle with transitions. An evening ritual signals: "Work is done. Rest begins."

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Choose 3-5 simple end-of-day actions:
   - Close laptop/put phone away
   - Tomorrow's Top 3 list
   - Gratitude for today
   - Lay out tomorrow's outfit/meds
   - 2-minute tidy
2. Put them in order
3. Add to Notion Evening Checklist
4. Try it tonight

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- This is for closure, not perfection
- If racing thoughts happen, brain dump them
- Set a reminder alarm (6pm, 9pm, whenever)
- Can be adjusted for energy level

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How does your evening usually feel? Chaotic? Rushed? Peaceful? What would help?_

---

### Day 9: The Clutter Hotspot

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Tackle ONE surface that drives you nuts

⏱️ **Time Required**: 15 minutes max  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium-High  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Take a photo of the clear space (dopamine!)

**Why This Matters**:
Visual clutter drains ADHD brains. Clearing ONE spot creates instant calm and proves you CAN make progress.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Pick ONE surface:
   - Kitchen counter
   - Desk
   - Nightstand
   - Couch
   - Car front seat
2. Set timer for 15 minutes
3. Clear everything off
4. Sort: Keep here, Move elsewhere, Trash
5. Put back only what belongs
6. STOP when timer rings (even if not perfect!)

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Just ONE surface today (don't spiral into whole room)
- Have a "don't know where this goes" box
- Take before/after photos
- Maintaining is okay too—doesn't have to stay perfect

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How does that clear surface make you feel? Want to do more? Or satisfied with this one win?_

---

### Day 10: Habit Stack Creation

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Link one new habit to an existing routine

⏱️ **Time Required**: 5 minutes to plan  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Celebrate when you do it tomorrow!

**Why This Matters**:
New habits fail when they require remembering. Linking them to existing habits removes that barrier.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Think of something you do every day without fail:
   - Make coffee
   - Brush teeth
   - Sit at desk
   - Get in car
2. Choose a tiny new habit (2 minutes or less):
   - Take vitamins
   - Do 5 pushups
   - Write one sentence
   - Drink a glass of water
3. Create the formula: "After I [EXISTING], I will [NEW]"
4. Write it down
5. Try it tomorrow

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Make new habit ridiculously small
- Put visual reminders at trigger spot
- Takes 2-3 weeks to feel automatic
- If it doesn't stick, try different trigger or habit

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What habit would make the biggest positive impact on your day?_

---

### Day 11: The "No" Practice

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Say "no" or "not now" to something today

⏱️ **Time Required**: Varies (the act itself)  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium (emotional energy)  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Whatever you did instead!

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD people-pleasers often overcommit. Saying "no" protects your energy and time for what truly matters.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Today, look for one opportunity to say no:
   - A request for your time
   - An invitation you don't want
   - An obligation that drains you
   - A project that's not aligned
2. Use a script if needed:
   - "I'd love to, but I don't have capacity right now"
   - "Let me check my schedule and get back to you"
   - "That doesn't work for me, but thanks for thinking of me"
3. Notice how it feels
4. Remind yourself: Saying no to this = saying yes to yourself

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- "Not right now" is also valid
- You don't owe detailed explanations
- Guilt is normal—it passes
- Protecting your energy is not selfish

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What did you say no to? How did it feel? What did you protect?_

---

### Day 12: Task Time Reality Check

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Track how long tasks ACTUALLY take vs. your estimate

⏱️ **Time Required**: Throughout the day  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low (just tracking)  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Laugh at your time blindness (lovingly!)

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD time blindness means we chronically under or overestimate. Real data helps you plan better.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Choose 3-5 tasks you'll do today
2. Before starting each, guess how long it'll take
3. Time the actual duration
4. Note the difference
5. Look for patterns

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Use timer app or phone stopwatch
- Include interruptions and transitions
- Don't judge yourself—just collect data
- Add "buffer time" to future estimates

**Reflection Prompt**:
_Are you an optimist (underestimate) or pessimist (overestimate)? Any patterns in which tasks you misjudge?_

---

### Day 13: The Reward System

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Design a points-based reward system

⏱️ **Time Required**: 15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Give yourself the first reward immediately!

**Why This Matters**:
External motivation structures help ADHD brains push through resistance. Make it a game!

**Step-by-Step**:
1. List tasks you consistently avoid
2. Assign points based on effort (not importance):
   - Annoying task: 5 points
   - Medium struggle: 10 points
   - Really hard: 20 points
   - Nightmare task: 50 points
3. Create reward tiers:
   - 25 pts: Small treat
   - 50 pts: Bigger reward
   - 100 pts: Special prize
4. List rewards you genuinely want
5. Set up in Notion (or use an app)

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Rewards should feel good, not "should do" activities
- Reset weekly so you never feel too behind
- Change rewards when they stop motivating
- Celebrate point milestones

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What rewards actually motivate you vs. what you think "should" motivate you?_

---

### Day 14: Weekly Review Lite

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Reflect on the past 2 weeks (gently!)

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10-15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Something special—you're halfway!

**Why This Matters**:
Pausing to look back prevents the feeling of "time is flying by and I'm not doing anything." You ARE doing things!

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Open your Notion or journal
2. Answer these questions:
   - What worked well these 2 weeks?
   - What was challenging?
   - Which day's challenge was most helpful?
   - What do I want to keep doing?
   - What can I let go of without guilt?
3. Celebrate: You're 14 days in! (Or however many you did—that counts!)

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Don't judge yourself for missed days
- Look for patterns, not perfection
- Something > nothing, always
- Adjust the second half based on what you learned

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How do you feel right now vs. Day 1? Any shifts in energy, clarity, or confidence?_

---

## Week 3: Integration & Momentum

### Day 15: The Context List

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Group tasks by location/context

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Batch complete a whole context!

**Why This Matters**:
Context switching drains ADHD brains. Batching similar tasks saves mental energy.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Look at your task list
2. Group by context:
   - 💻 Computer tasks
   - 📱 Phone calls/texts
   - 🏪 Errands (when out)
   - 🏠 Home chores
   - 🧠 Deep thinking
3. Add context tags in your Notion Tasks
4. Create context views
5. Next time you're at computer/in car/have phone: do all those tasks at once

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Reduces "I'm at my desk but have to do this other thing elsewhere" frustration
- Can save tasks for when you're in right place
- Phone calls batch especially well
- "Waiting for response" is a valid context

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How much time do you lose to context switching? Would batching help?_

---

### Day 16: Sensory Self-Care Audit

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Identify what sensory inputs help you focus or calm

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Try a new sensory tool!

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD brains need the right level of stimulation. Too much = overload. Too little = understimulation. Find your sweet spot.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. For each sense, note what helps:
   - **Sound**: Music? Silence? White noise? Nature sounds?
   - **Touch**: Fidgets? Textures? Weighted blanket? Temperature?
   - **Sight**: Dimmed lights? Bright colors? Decluttered space?
   - **Smell**: Scents that ground you? Candles? Fresh air?
   - **Taste**: Gum? Mints? Crunchy snacks? Water?
2. List tools you have and want
3. Add to dopamine menu
4. Create a "sensory reset" ritual

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Everyone's different—no "right" answers
- Experiment to find what works
- Overstimulation and understimulation both happen
- Build a sensory toolkit

**Reflection Prompt**:
_Are you more often overstimulated or understimulated? What helps each?_

---

### Day 17: The Maintenance Checklist

🎯 **Today's Mission**: List recurring tasks that keep life running

⏱️ **Time Required**: 15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Schedule them and forget!

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD brains forget recurring tasks. Making them visible prevents crises (out of meds! out of milk! car registration expired!).

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Brain dump recurring responsibilities:
   - Daily: meds, feed pets, check email
   - Weekly: laundry, groceries, trash/recycling
   - Monthly: bills, pet meds, clean filters
   - Quarterly: car maintenance, HVAC, doctor checkups
   - Annually: taxes, registrations, subscriptions
2. Add to Notion with frequency tags
3. Set reminders or recurring tasks
4. Batch similar maintenance tasks

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Automate what you can (auto-pay, subscriptions)
- Visual reminders work better than mental notes
- Share tasks with household members
- "Good enough" maintenance counts

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What maintenance task do you always forget until it's urgent? How can you prevent that?_

---

### Day 18: The Energy Match Game

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Match today's tasks to your actual energy level

⏱️ **Time Required**: 5 minutes + doing the tasks  
💪 **Energy Level**: Whatever you've got!  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Proud that you worked WITH yourself!

**Why This Matters**:
Fighting your energy level creates frustration. Matching tasks to energy creates flow and accomplishment.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Check your current energy: Low/Medium/High
2. Look at your task list
3. Filter by matching energy requirement
4. Do 1-3 tasks from that level
5. Avoid forcing high-energy tasks on low-energy days

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Low energy days are for admin, easy tasks, rest
- Medium energy for routine work
- High energy for creative, complex, important work
- Energy levels change—check regularly

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How did it feel to honor your energy level instead of fighting it?_

---

### Day 19: Social Battery Check

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Assess your social needs and limits

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Honor your social preference today!

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD can mean social overwhelm OR isolation. Understanding your social battery helps you balance.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Reflect on your social patterns:
   - Do you feel energized or drained by socializing?
   - How much solo time do you need?
   - What types of social time feel good vs. draining?
   - When is your battery most full/empty?
2. Create categories:
   - High-energy social (parties, networking)
   - Medium (coffee with friend, phone call)
   - Low (text, online chat, parallel play)
   - Recharge (alone time, nature, quiet)
3. Note this in your Notion Wellness Tracker

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- You can be extroverted AND need alone time
- It's okay to cancel when battery is empty
- Parallel play (together but separate activities) counts
- Online friends are real friends

**Reflection Prompt**:
_Is your social battery currently full, medium, or empty? What do you need?_

---

### Day 20: Digital Declutter Day

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Delete/organize 20 things on your phone

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10-15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low-Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Extra phone storage space!

**Why This Matters**:
Digital clutter creates the same mental drain as physical clutter. Small clearing helps!

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Choose one area of your phone:
   - Photos: Delete 20 screenshots/blurry pics
   - Apps: Delete 5 you never use
   - Emails: Delete/unsubscribe from 10
   - Tabs: Close all (yes, all of them)
   - Notes: Process 5 random notes
2. Set timer for 15 minutes
3. Go!
4. Stop when timer ends

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Don't aim for perfection—just better
- If you hesitate to delete, you don't need it
- Can always re-download apps
- Cloud storage means photos are safe

**Reflection Prompt**:
_How does a clearer phone feel? Less mental noise?_

---

### Day 21: The Guilt Release

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Write down and release one source of guilt

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium (emotional work)  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Gentle self-care after

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD often comes with excessive guilt. Today, we practice letting go of one thing you're carrying.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Identify something you feel guilty about:
   - Unfinished project
   - Unanswered message
   - Missed event
   - "Wasted" time
   - Past mistake
2. Write it out: What happened? Why do you feel guilty?
3. Ask: Is this guilt helping or hurting me?
4. Choose:
   - Fix it (if you can and want to)
   - Apologize (if needed)
   - Let it go (most common choice)
5. Write a release statement: "I release myself from guilt about [X]. I am doing my best."

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Guilt doesn't mean you did something wrong
- ADHD often creates disproportionate guilt
- Forgiveness includes forgiving yourself
- You don't have to earn freedom from guilt

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What would your life feel like without this particular guilt? Can you let it go?_

---

## Week 4: Long-Term Sustainability

### Day 22: The Quarterly Vision

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Imagine your life 3 months from now

⏱️ **Time Required**: 15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Dream big—this is future you!

**Why This Matters**:
Without a direction, ADHD brains drift. A quarterly vision (not rigid goals!) gives gentle guidance.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Fast forward 90 days from today
2. Imagine your ideal state (realistic, not perfect):
   - How do you FEEL?
   - What's better in your life?
   - What habits are in place?
   - What stress is gone?
   - Who are you becoming?
3. Write this vision down
4. Identify 1-3 focus areas to support this vision
5. No detailed plan yet—just the vision

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Focus on feelings, not achievements
- "I feel more organized" vs "I organized everything"
- This is a direction, not a destination
- Visions can change—that's okay

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What's one thing that would make the biggest positive difference in 90 days?_

---

### Day 23: System Simplification

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Remove one thing from your daily routine

⏱️ **Time Required**: 5 minutes to decide  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: More free time/energy!

**Why This Matters**:
We add habits and routines but rarely subtract. Sometimes the most powerful change is LESS.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Look at your daily routine
2. Identify one thing that:
   - Drains more than it gives
   - You do out of "should" not "want"
   - Takes time but doesn't move the needle
   - Creates stress
3. Decide: Can you drop it? Delegate it? Reduce it?
4. Give yourself permission to let it go
5. Try life without it for a week

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Less is often more with ADHD brains
- Complexity is the enemy of sustainability
- If you don't miss it after a week, keep it gone
- You can always add things back

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What are you doing out of obligation that doesn't serve you? What would you do with freed-up time?_

---

### Day 24: The Support System Map

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Identify who helps you and how

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10-15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Reach out to someone on your list!

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD is easier with support. Knowing who to ask for what reduces barriers to getting help.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Create categories of support you need:
   - Accountability buddy
   - Body doubling partner
   - Emotional support
   - Practical help (rides, childcare, etc.)
   - Expert advice (therapist, coach, etc.)
   - Emergency contact
2. For each, name who you can ask
3. Note their availability/preferences
4. Save in your Notion Dashboard
5. Practice asking for help this week

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Different people for different needs is okay
- Online friends/communities count
- Reciprocal support is powerful
- Asking for help is strength, not weakness

**Reflection Prompt**:
_Who makes your ADHD life easier? Have you thanked them? What support do you need that you don't have?_

---

### Day 25: The Obstacle Plan

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Identify your top 3 ADHD obstacles and plan for them

⏱️ **Time Required**: 15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Feel prepared for challenges!

**Why This Matters**:
Knowing your patterns means you can plan ahead. When the obstacle shows up, you already have a strategy.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. List your top 3 ADHD obstacles:
   - Task initiation paralysis
   - Rejection sensitivity
   - Time blindness
   - Emotional dysregulation
   - Executive function crashes
   - Hyperfocus that won't stop
   - (Or your specific ones)
2. For each, write:
   - Warning signs it's happening
   - What makes it worse
   - What helps (even a little)
   - Who to ask for help

### Day 26: The Celebration Archive

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Document wins from the past month

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10-15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Low  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Reread this when you're struggling!

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD brains forget progress. A wins archive is proof you're moving forward, even when it doesn't feel like it.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Open your Notion Wins Journal (or create one)
2. List wins from the past 30 days:
   - Tasks completed
   - Habits maintained
   - Hard conversations had
   - Things you learned
   - People you helped
   - Self-care moments
   - Days you survived
3. Include TINY wins—they count most!
4. Add photos, screenshots, or evidence if you have it
5. Read the whole list and feel proud

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- "Got out of bed" is a valid win on hard days
- Wins are not just achievements—learning counts too
- Compare to your past self, not others
- Reread this archive when impostor syndrome hits

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What surprised you about your wins list? Did you remember all of these?_

### Day 27: The Boundary Practice

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Set ONE boundary that protects your ADHD needs

⏱️ **Time Required**: 5-10 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium (emotional)  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Feel the relief!

**Why This Matters**:
ADHD brains need protection from overstimulation, overcommitment, and others' expectations. Boundaries are self-care.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Identify one area where you need a boundary:
   - Work hours (stop answering emails at night)
   - Social time (limit to X hours per week)
   - Noise (ask housemates for quiet time)
   - Interruptions (do not disturb mode)
   - Expectations (say no to non-essential commitments)
2. State the boundary clearly:
   - "I need [X] in order to [Y]"
   - Example: "I need 2 hours of quiet each morning to focus"
3. Communicate it to relevant people
4. Practice enforcing it this week

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Boundaries are not selfish—they're necessary
- Start with one small boundary
- You don't need to explain or justify
- Boundary guilt is normal—it passes
- Protect your hyperfocus time especially

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What boundary would make the biggest difference to your wellbeing? Who needs to know about it?_

### Day 28: The Future Self Letter

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Write a letter to yourself one month from now

⏱️ **Time Required**: 15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: Set a reminder to reread in 30 days!

**Why This Matters**:
Future you needs encouragement from present you. This creates continuity and reminds you of your journey.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Write a letter to yourself 30 days from now
2. Include:
   - What you hope you've learned
   - What you're proud of present you for
   - Reminders of what works for you
   - Compassion for any struggles
   - Hope for what's possible
3. Save in your Notion
4. Set calendar reminder to read on Day 58

**Letter Prompts**:
- Dear Future Me...
- I hope by now you've...
- Remember that you...
- I'm proud of you for...
- Keep going because...

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- No pressure for it to be profound
- Honest over perfect
- Include what you DON'T want future you to forget
- This is for you, not anyone else

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What do you want to tell your future self? What does your future self need to hear?_

### Day 29: System Customization

🎯 **Today's Mission**: Adjust ONE thing in your ADHD Flow OS to work better for you

⏱️ **Time Required**: 10-15 minutes  
💪 **Energy Level**: Medium  
🎁 **Reward Idea**: System that fits YOUR brain!

**Why This Matters**:
Generic systems fail for ADHD brains. Customization makes it YOURS, which means you'll actually use it.

**Step-by-Step**:
1. Review your Notion dashboard
2. Ask yourself:
   - What have I NOT used? (can remove or simplify)
   - What do I use ALL the time? (make it more prominent)
   - What's missing that I keep needing?
   - What's more complex than it needs to be?
3. Make ONE adjustment:
   - Change colors/icons
   - Reorder sections
   - Add a view or remove one
   - Create a new quick-capture button
   - Adjust a database property
4. Test it for a few days

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- Your system should reduce friction, not add it
- What works for others might not work for you
- Iterate constantly—systems evolve
- Function over aesthetics (but aesthetics help!)

**Reflection Prompt**:
_What part of your system feels clunky? What would make it more YOU?_

   - Schedule next monthly review
   - Share your journey (if you want!)

**✨ ADHD Tips**:
- You don't have to keep doing ALL 30 things
- Choose 3-5 practices to continue
- It's okay if you only did 15/30 days—that's still growth!
- Systems evolve—what works now might change

**Final Reflection Prompts**:
- _Who are you becoming through this practice?_
- _What do you want to remember about this journey?_
- _What are you most proud of?_
- _What's possible for you now that wasn't 30 days ago?_
