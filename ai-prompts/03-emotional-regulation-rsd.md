## When to Seek Additional Help

### These prompts are NOT a replacement for:
- Mental health crisis intervention
- Therapy for trauma or severe anxiety
- Medication management
- Emergency services

### Signs you need more support:
- Emotions regularly interfere with daily life
- RSD episodes are increasing
- Can't function due to emotional intensity
- Experiencing suicidal thoughts (call crisis line immediately)
- Self-harm urges
- Inability to maintain relationships

**You deserve support. These prompts are tools, not treatment. Use them alongside professional help when needed.** 💜

**Remember**: Your feelings are valid. ADHD emotional intensity is real. You're not "too sensitive" or "overreacting" — your brain just experiences emotions at maximum volume. These tools help you navigate that reality with compassion and skill. 🧠✨
