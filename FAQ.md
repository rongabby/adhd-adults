### Who is this for?
Adults 25-45 who are diagnosed or self-identify as ADHD (or AuDHD), feel scattered/burned out, and are familiar with or interested in Notion.

### How is this different from other Notion templates?
- **First comprehensive ADHD template with AI integration**
- Specifically designed for executive dysfunction and ADHD challenges

### Do I need to have ADHD to create this?
Not necessarily, but:
- Deep understanding of ADHD challenges is crucial

- Be authentic and transparent about your connection to ADHD

## Building Questions

- **Complete bundle with workbooks**: 20-40 hours
- **Professional polish**: Additional 10-20 hours
- **Total**: Plan for 1-2 weeks of part-time work

### Do I need coding skills?
No! Everything is built using:
- Notion's native features (no-code)
- Basic design skills (Canva level)
